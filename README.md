# New-Product-Example
A collaborative project to facilitate learning the role of systems engineering in the product lifecycle

This project was conceived on the Systems Engineering Professionals Discord server as a way to facilitate discussion on systems engineering practices in the product life cycle. This repository will allow the consolidation and sharing of longer form work than the discussion on Discord. 

The initial task of the project is to select a "product" for development.
