Everyone needs to think about the business case that will help us choose the shared 
    example from 2 perspectives (not viewpoints): 
1) the business case for the example product: why would a company make this thing
2) the business case for using the example

    Some criteria for people suggesting an example (we should formalize this so others can use it):
1) is the example understood by a broad range of people on the Discord channel?
2) does the example cover mechanical, electrical, electronic, software disciplines?
3) is the example understandable, but difficult enough to require cooperation from the team?
4) does the example force us to consider business drivers: market acceptance/share, PM, funding, 
   ROI, ... (you business analysts can help me out here - collaboration - Yay!)
5) as many as we can brainstorm. we will then decide on the top ~10 - 20 and use them in a 
   decision matrix to pick the example.

So everybody get to work on your Product Business Case and think about the Example Business Case. 
(This part of the exercise addresses business analysis, one of the places systems engineers say 
they are needed)
